		<p>New Yorkers rallied last summer to demand better access to clean and safe public restrooms. According to data from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, there are less than 200 public restrooms in Manhattan’s parks, a city of 1.6 million residents and with an official city estimate of over 60,000 homeless people.</p>

		<p>That number leaves large gaps for the street homeless, according to Josh Dean, the executive director of Human.nyc. His organization does research about homelessness and advocates for the homeless. “A lot of homeless folks experience urinary tract issues and other health-related problems at a rate that’s [up to] 300% higher than the general population, because they don’t have any place to go to the bathroom,” Dean said. “They may also suffer from dehydration because knowing they don’t have anywhere to go to the bathroom they aren’t drinking as much water, which isn’t healthy.”</p>

		<p>In addition to health effects, lack of access to 24-hour public restrooms in parks can lead to arrests or fines for people living on the street. Dean says people often have no viable options when they are in need of a restroom. “I know a lot of people who get ticketed for public urination because they don’t have anywhere else to go.”</p>
